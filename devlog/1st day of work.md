It's my first day ! I have a lot of ideas but with my level in game dev, i decided to do something simple.

Inspired by games like Emily is Away, it's time to do my own MSN Messenger ! (lmao) 
My idea is very simple, a game who can be ported on a real chat app like Discord or Skype uwu. But i want to add something more... personnal.
I'm solo, so it's difficult to do something incredible, I don't know how to draw. So let's create an interactive story !
